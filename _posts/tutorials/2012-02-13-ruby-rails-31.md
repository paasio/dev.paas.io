category: tutorials

In this tutorial, we will cover how to deploy a brand new Rails 3.1
application to PaaS.io, focusing primarily on the configuration changes
that are necessary.

## Prerequisites

* Basic Rails knowledge, including Bundler
* Ruby already installed
* Basic knowledge of Git, or Mercurial if you wish to use Mercurial

## Create Your Application

{% highlight bash %}
$ rails new myapp
$ cd myapp
{% endhighlight %}

#### Gemfile updates

In your Gemfile, add the following:

{% highlight ruby %}
group :production do
  gem 'thin'
end
{% endhighlight %}

If you are also using a MySQL database, PaaS.io will automatically
generate the `database.yml` on deploy with the proper credentials,
however you'll need to be sure to include the `mysql2` gem in the
production group:

{% highlight ruby %}
gem 'mysql2'
{% endhighlight %}

Now need to run bundler to make sure it regenerates the `Gemfile.lock`:

{% highlight bash %}
$ bundle install
{% endhighlight %}

## Adding to Source Control

If using Git, you can now create a repository:

{% highlight bash %}
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Initial Commit"
{% endhighlight %}

## Deploying Your Application

If you don't have it already, would recommend installing the PaaS.io
command line tool:

{% highlight bash %}
$ gem install paasio
{% endhighlight %}

To create your application, use `paasio create`

{% highlight bash %}
$ paasio create my-rails31-app
Using application name "my-rails31-app"...
Application Deployed URL [my-rails31-app.paas.io]:
Detected a Rails Application, is this correct? [Yn]:
Memory Reservation (256M, 512M, 1G, 2G) [256M]:
Creating Application: OK
Git remote paasio added
{% endhighlight %}

Since it saw we were using a Git
repository, it automatically added a `paasio` remote to our repository:

{% highlight bash %}
$ git remote show paasio
* remote paasio
  Fetch URL: deploy@paas.io:my-rails31-app.git
  Push  URL: deploy@paas.io:my-rails31-app.git
  HEAD branch: (unknown)
{% endhighlight %}

The HEAD branch portion says "(unknown)" because we haven't yet pushed
anything to it.

Now we're ready to deploy it.

{% highlight bash %}
$ git push -u paasio master

 * [new branch]      master -> master
Branch master set up to track remote branch master from paasio.
{% endhighlight %}

Your application is now live! When deploying, it may sit at the "Staging
Application" stage for a little while at first.  It is working on
installing all of the necessary gems. On future deploys, it will be much
quicker since it will cache compiled gems for future use.

We specify the `-u` parameter in the push command because this sets up
tracking in Git. With that, when you run `git status`, it will show you
how many commits haven't been pushed to PaaS.io yet.

## Common Questions

#### Migrations

Migrations are automatically checked and ran when an application is
starting up.

#### Rails Console

Currently we do not have support for loading the Rails console.
Support for this will be coming soon.

#### Rake Tasks

Currently we do not support running one-off rake tasks. Supporting them
is on our roadmap though.
